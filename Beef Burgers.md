# Burgers

## Ingredients
- Beef mince (300g+, ideally 5%-10% fat)
- Parsely
- 1 (Red) Onion
- 2 Garlic cloves
- 1 Slice white bread
- Worcestershire sauce
- Parmesan
- 1 egg
- Lettuce
- (Beef) Tomato
- Burger buns
- Oil suitable for frying (Virgin or refined Olive Oil)
- Cheese (optional)
- Halloumi (optional)
- Mayo (optional)

## Method
- (If using Halloumi) Put a pan on medium to high heat. Cut the halloumi into roughly 1cm slices. Lay them on the pan, either in a ring on the outside, or bunched up in the middle.
    - Once the browning on one side is done, flip over and brown the other side.
    - Remove from pan set aside wrapped in foil.
- Roughly cut the bread slices, put into a bowl and use an immersion blender to make small bread crumbs.
- Put minced beef into bowl, add chopped onion, minced garlic, bread crumbs, splash of worcestershire sauce, grated parmesan, salt/pepper.
- Crack and egg into a seperate bowl and wisk slightly. Add enough egg to make the mix stick together, but not too wet.
- Divide mix into balls on a foil sheet. Press down on balls to make burger patties.
- Heat up the pan to medium-high heat then add the burgers. Place a sheet of foil over the pan so the burger heats more eavenly.
- Once you're happy with the browning, flip the burger and heat the other side. If using cheese, you can add it to the top in the final few minutes to start it melting.
    - When you're satisfied, take the burgers out and place them on some kitchen roll to soak up any residual oil.
- Toast the burger buns and apply mayo on each side.
- Assemble the burger however you want.
