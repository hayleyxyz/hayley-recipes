# Onion Gravy

## Ingredients

- 1 Onion
- 2 Garlic cloves
- 1 tsp Brown sugar (optional)
- ~250ml Beef stock
- Red wine (optional, but highly recommended)
- Thyme
- Rosemary, Sage, Oregano etc. (optional)
- Worcestershire sauce
- Corn flour
- Virgin or Refined Olive oil
- Butter

## Method

- Chop onions. Whatever size you prefer; I tend to do finer pieces. Mince the garlic cloves.
- Add oil to pan and heat to medium-high heat.
  - Put the kettle on for the beef stock at this stage.
- Add a chunk of butter (about 15g). Add the onions and fry for a minute or two.
- Add the brown sugar, if using, stir. Add the minced garlic.
  - Make sure the beef stock is prepared and ready.
- Add another 15-20g of butter. Once it's melted, add the flour, one half-to whole tablespoon at a time while constantly whisking. You can also pour in some of the broth at this stage too. Ensure you are keeping the consistency you want.
- If using red wine, add that too while stirring and keeping the consistency.
- Season with worcestershire sauce, herbs, salt, pepper.
- Leave to simmer on low for at least 10 mins.
  - You can leave it longer while you do other things and it will enhance the flavour, but you need to be mindful of the consistency as it will thicken.
