# Lemon and Herb Chicken Wraps

For 2 people

# Ingredients
- Large (30cm) wraps
- Chicken breast (400g+)
- 2 Garlic cloves
- Parsely (ideally fresh)
- Rosemary (ideally fresh/sprigs)
- Thyme (ideally fresh/sprigs)
- Oil suitable for frying (Virgin or refined Olive Oil)
- 1 Lemon
- Lettuce
- Tomato
- Mayo
- Halloumi

# Method
- Cut the chicken into strips or chunks. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Add to a bowl/container.
- Roughly chop or mince the garlic. Chop the parsely.
- Add the chopped garlic to the bowl with the chicken. Add the parsely, 1-2 rosemary sprigs, 2-4 thyme sprigs.
- Add enough olive oil to cover the chicken, then squeeze the lemon into the mixture. Then stir the contents of the bowl.
    - You can also grate some lemon zest, but I usually skip this to avoid additional washing up.
- Cover the bowl and put into the fridge to marinate.
    - Leave for at least 30mins.
- Put a pan on medium to high heat. Cut the halloumi into roughly 1cm slices. Lay them on the pan, either in a ring on the outside, or bunched up in the middle.
    - Once the browning on one side is done, flip over and brown the other side.
    - Remove from pan set aside wrapped in foil.
- Wipe down the pan and using tongs, put place the chicken pieces from the marinade bowl into the pan. There should be more than enough olive oil with the chicken for the pan.
- Cover the pan with a lid or sheet of foil. Cook on medium to high heat. Turn after the top of the chicken starts to whiten.
- Once cooked, assemble wraps with lettuce, chopped tomato, chicken, halloumi and mayo.
